# NIDA
NIDA, an open-source software that noninvasively detects hemoglobin concentration using raw image from a con- sumer camera 
and a color calibration card.The patient pull lower conjunctiva downwards with one hand while holding a color calibration 
card in the other hand. Photographs are then taken and analyzed using the software. Hemoglobin measurement is a standard 
clinical tool commonly used for screening anemia and assessing a patient’s response to iron supplement treatments. Anemia is 
a major health burden worldwide. Although the finding of conjunctival pallor on clinical examination is associated with 
anemia, inter-observer variability is high, and definitive diagnosis of anemia requires a blood sample. My goal was to
develop a low cost and non-invasive screening test for anemia .


# PROBLEM DEFINITION
About 58% children between the age 6–59 months are anemic with Hb level less than 11.0 g/dl.Non-pregnant women between age 
15–49 years having Hb level less than 12 g/dl is 53.1% and pregnant women between age 15–49 years who are anemic(< 11.0 g/dl) 
is 50.3%. Among men, anemia is less with about 23% men being anemic with Hb level less than 13.0 g/dl.

Although nutritional problem is very common in all states, it is more prevalent and severe in the particular states, whose 
performances are very poor in respect of the other important demographic and socioeconomic indicators. The Government of India
(GOI) has named these states as Empowered Action Groups (EAG) states, which consist of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya 
Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhat- tisgarh, and Rajasthan. The EAG states comprise almost 45% of Indian population.

There is currently no health services being provided by the government or private organizations which is cost-effective , 
convenient and reaches people across all rural and urban areas. Also, no medical history is maintained of the people which 
can be accessed digitally across the globe.

# PROPOSED SOLUTIONS
A quick and convenient delivery of health services which can reach distant areas, this will reduce footfall in government 
hospitals, with service delivery closer-to-home. To use the best of what we have we could use the basic services already 
pro- vided to the consumer through eMitra (G2C and B2C services provided by the government of Rajasthan). Government of 
Rajasthan have set up the eMitra platform of eGovernance way back in the year 2004. Currently, covering all rural and urban 
areas in 33 districts of Rajasthan. EMitra platforms already have the access to computers, cameras and printers. So, a 
technology which could use these already available facilities to provide health services would be beneficial for the people.

The solution provided in this paper aimed to detect anemia by quantifying conjunctival pallor using digital photographs taken
with a consumer camera. Before it could be used, refinement of the image standardization technique to reduce the impact of 
device and lighting characteristics is required [2]. Following techniques could be used for the refinement of the image 
standardization.
