\label{sec:back}

Anaemia is a major health burden worldwide. Although the finding of conjunctival pallor on
clinical examination is associated with anaemia, inter-observer variability is high, and defini-
tive diagnosis of anaemia requires a blood sample. We aimed to detect anaemia by quanti-
fying conjunctival pallor using digital photographs taken with a consumer camera and a
popular smartphone. Our goal was to develop a non-invasive screening test for anaemia . \cite{plos}
